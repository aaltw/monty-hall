# Monty Hall Terminal Application - Project Specification

## Executive Summary

A Go-based terminal application that implements the famous Monty Hall probability problem with an interactive terminal user interface (TUI). The application will educate users about counterintuitive probability through gameplay, statistical tracking, and educational explanations.

## Project Overview

### The Monty Hall Problem
The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on the TV game show "Let's Make a Deal":
1. Three doors hide prizes: one car (valuable) and two goats (less valuable)
2. Contestant chooses one door initially
3. Host opens one of the remaining doors, revealing a goat
4. Contestant can stick with original choice or switch to the other unopened door
5. Counterintuitively, switching gives 2/3 probability of winning vs 1/3 for staying

### Application Purpose
- Demonstrate the Monty Hall problem interactively
- Track statistics to prove the 2/3 vs 1/3 probability difference
- Educate users about probability and statistical thinking
- Provide an engaging, visual learning experience

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Player choice tracking (initial selection, final decision)
- Win/loss determination

#### FR2: Interactive Terminal UI
- Visual representation of three doors
- Navigation between doors using keyboard
- Clear indication of game phases
- Animated door opening sequences
- Color-coded feedback (prizes vs goats)

#### FR3: Statistics Tracking
- Track wins/losses for "stick" vs "switch" strategies
- Calculate and display win percentages
- Persistent storage of statistics across sessions
- Reset statistics functionality
- Export statistics data

#### FR4: Educational Features
- Tutorial mode for first-time users
- Explanations of probability mathematics
- "Why does this work?" educational content
- Historical context about the problem
- Interactive probability demonstrations

#### FR5: User Experience

- Instant response to user input
- Smooth animations (where supported)
- Minimal memory footprint
- Fast startup time (<1 second)

#### NFR2: Compatibility
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Various terminal emulators
- Minimum terminal size: 80x24 characters
- Graceful handling of limited color support

#### NFR3: Maintainability
- Clean, well-documented Go code
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- Following Go best practices and idioms

#### NFR4: Usability
- Intuitive interface requiring no manual
- Clear visual feedback for all actions
- Accessible to users with basic terminal knowledge
- Educational value for probability concepts

## User Stories

### Primary Users: Students and Educators

**US1**: As a student learning probability, I want to play the Monty Hall game so I can understand why switching doors is better.

**US2**: As a teacher, I want to demonstrate the Monty Hall problem to my class so they can see the counterintuitive result.

**US3**: As a curious person, I want to see statistical proof over many games so I can convince myself that switching really works.

### Secondary Users: Developers and Enthusiasts

**US4**: As a Go developer, I want to see a well-structured TUI application as a reference for my own projects.

**US5**: As a probability enthusiast, I want detailed explanations of the mathematics so I can understand the theory.

## Success Criteria

### Educational Effectiveness
- Users understand the 2/3 vs 1/3 probability after using the application
- Statistical results converge to theoretical probabilities over many games
- Tutorial mode successfully guides new users through the concept

### Technical Quality
- Application runs reliably across target platforms
- Code passes all tests and linting checks
- Performance meets specified requirements
- UI is responsive and intuitive

### User Satisfaction
- Users find the application engaging and educational
- Interface is clear and easy to navigate
- Educational content is helpful and accurate

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Terminal-only interface (no GUI)
- Go programming language
- Single-user application (no networking)
- Local file storage only

### Assumptions
- Users have basic terminal/command-line knowledge
- Terminal supports at least 80x24 character display
- Users are interested in learning about probability
- Go 1.21+ is available for development

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Terminal compatibility**: Different terminals may render differently
  - *Mitigation*: Test on major terminal emulators, graceful degradation
- **Animation support**: Not all terminals support smooth animations
  - *Mitigation*: Detect capabilities, fallback to static display

### Educational Risks
- **Concept complexity**: Probability can be difficult to understand
  - *Mitigation*: Multiple explanation approaches, interactive demonstrations
- **User engagement**: Terminal interface may seem outdated
  - *Mitigation*: Modern TUI framework, engaging animations and colors

## Deliverables

1. **Source Code**: Complete Go application with all features
2. **Documentation**: User guide, developer documentation, API docs
3. **Tests**: Comprehensive test suite with high coverage
4. **Binaries**: Cross-platform executable releases
5. **Specifications**: This complete specification document set

## Timeline and Phases

The project is divided into 6 phases for iterative development:
1. **Phase 1**: Core game logic (2-3 days)
2. **Phase 2**: Statistics tracking (1-2 days)
3. **Phase 3**: Basic terminal UI (3-4 days)
4. **Phase 4**: Enhanced visuals (2-3 days)
5. **Phase 5**: Educational features (2-3 days)
6. **Phase 6**: Polish and optimization (1-2 days)

**Total estimated time**: 11-17 days
